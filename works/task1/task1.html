                <p>Starting this front-end development course is a big step for me. Iâ€™ve always been curious about how websites are built and how they look amazing. Through this course, I hope to gain the skills and knowledge I need to create them independently. I aim to learn new tools and improve my abilities and opportunities.</p>

            <section>
                <p>I picked this course because I want to learn how to design and build websites that are not just good-looking but also easy for people to use. I enjoy both solving problems and being creative, and front-end development brings these two things together.</p>

            <section>
                <p>By the time I finish this course, I want to feel confident using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These are the core skills every web developer needs, and I want to master them. I also hope to explore tools like React, which make creating interactive and modern websites much easier.</p>

                <p>This course is an important step toward my dream of becoming a front-end developer. I want to use what I learn here to work on real projects and build a strong portfolio, which will help me stand out when applying for jobs in web development.</p>

            <section>
                <p>The tool I am most excited about learning is React. React is widely used to make websites that are fast and interactive, and I believe it will make me a better developer.</p>
